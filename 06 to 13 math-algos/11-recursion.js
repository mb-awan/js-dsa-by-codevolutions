// What ?
// =======
// ->   Recursion is a problem solving technique where solution 
//      depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem 
// OR
// ->   Recursion is when a function calls itself

// Why ?
// ======

// ->   A great technique to simplify your solution
// ->   if you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller
//      versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful

// A few Points About Recursion :

// ->   Every recursion solution need to have a base case - a condition to 
//      terminate the recursion.
// ->   Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always
//      translate to a faster solution.
// ->   A recursive solution may be sometimes far worse compared to an iterative
//      solution.
// ->   Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand.
// ->   Do not give up if you might struggle with the concepts.
